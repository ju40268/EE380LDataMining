    "Adagrad (http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) differs from vanilla SGD in that the learning rate of each weight changes over updates. A cache is maintained that holds the sum of squares of all gradients upto the current update. The learning_rate is divided by the cache, resulting in a different learning rate for each weight. A consequence of this update rule is that weights that have already seen large gradients (made large jumps) make smaller updates in subsequent iterations.\n",
